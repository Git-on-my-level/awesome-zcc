# Development Modes

Engineering, debugging, and architecture-focused AI personalities.

## Available Modes

<!-- Add development modes here -->

## Mode Categories

- **Engineering**: General software development assistance
- **Debugging**: Systematic problem-solving and troubleshooting
- **Architecture**: System design and technical decision-making
- **Code Review**: Focused on code quality and best practices

## Example Usage

```bash
# Use an engineering mode for feature development
zcc add mode full-stack-developer
/mode full-stack-developer

# Ask: "Help me implement user authentication"
# Result: Gets comprehensive full-stack guidance

# Switch to debugging mode for troubleshooting
/mode debugging-specialist  
# Ask: "My API is returning 500 errors"
# Result: Gets systematic debugging approach

# Use architecture mode for design decisions
/mode software-architect
# Ask: "Should I use microservices for this project?"
# Result: Gets architectural analysis and recommendations
```

## Best Practices

- **Match mode to task**: Use engineering modes for coding, debugging modes for troubleshooting
- **Provide context**: Share your tech stack, project size, and constraints
- **Ask specific questions**: "How do I optimize this React component?" vs "Help me with React"
- **Combine with workflows**: Use debugging workflows with debugging modes for maximum effectiveness

## Contributing

To contribute a development mode:

1. Create your mode following the [component format](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#component-requirements)
2. Test thoroughly with real development scenarios
3. Include examples of typical interactions
4. Submit a pull request

Development modes should focus on practical coding assistance and maintain a professional, helpful tone.
