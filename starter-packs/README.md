## About Starter Packs

Starter packs are curated collections of components that work well together for specific types of development. They provide a quick way to set up a complete zcc environment for a particular domain.

### Usage

```bash
# Install a starter pack
zcc add pack community/pack-name

# This installs multiple components at once:
# - Relevant modes for the domain
# - Common workflows and procedures  
# - Specialized agents and tools
```
