A curated list of awesome modes, workflows, agents, and starter packs for [zcc](https://github.com/dazheng/zcc) - the zsh for Claude Code.

## What is zcc?

zcc is to Claude Code what zsh is to bash. It enhances, customizes, and empowers Claude Code through themes (modes), plugins (agents/workflows), configuration, and automation. Think of it as building oh-my-zsh for AI development.
