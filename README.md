A curated list of awesome modes, workflows, agents, and starter packs for [zcc](https://github.com/dazheng/zcc) - the zsh for Claude Code.

## What is zcc?

zcc is to Claude Code what zsh is to bash. It enhances, customizes, and empowers Claude Code through packs (containing modes, agents, and workflows), configuration, and automation. Think of it as building oh-my-zsh for AI development.

## Contents

- [Quick Start](#quick-start) - Get started with awesome-zcc packs
- [Available Packs](#available-packs) - Domain-specific component packages
- [Contributing](#contributing) - Add your own packs and components

   - `/packs/` - Self-contained packages with modes, workflows, and agents organized by domain

2. **Explore Packs**: Browse the `/packs/` directory to find domain-specific packages with their manifest.json files.

3. **Filter by Tags**: Components are tagged for easy discovery:
   - `react`, `frontend`, `backend`, `debugging`, `security`, `performance`, etc.
